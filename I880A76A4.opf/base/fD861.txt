Brief Confession to the Earth Lords1
by Karma Chakme

kyé, dak dang gyujor yöndak gi
Kye! Whatever we practitioners and our patrons
lha lunyen sum khyé nam la
Have done towards the devas, nāgas and nyen spirits,2
pama ngarab depa dang
Including the actions of our ancestors from the past,
butsa chirab yenché du
And of our descendants in the future—
sa nyen kö dang do nyen long
Transgressions, such as digging up the spirits of the earth, raising the spirits of stone,3
chu nyen truk dang shing nyen ché
Stirring the spirits of water, cutting the spirits of trees,
dur tab shin lé gang jé sok
Disturbing burial ground and funeral rites, and the like—
marik wang gi chigyi pa
Whatever we have done in our ignorance,4
tol lo shak so dak gyur chik
We hereby declare and confess: may it all be purified!

Written by the learned and accomplished Rāga Asya.
